# sghtmltopdf

Ruby binding for [sghtmltopdf](https://github.com/waka/sghtmltopdf), an HTML-to-PDF renderer written in Rust that does not depend on Chromium, WebKit, or Gecko.

The engine runs inside your process through a native extension (magnus + rb-sys) — no subprocess, no temporary files — and releases the GVL while rendering, so other Puma threads keep running.

[Documentation](https://waka.github.io/sghtmltopdf/en/usage/ruby_rails.html) · [Repository](https://github.com/waka/sghtmltopdf) · [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/waka/sghtmltopdf/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## Install

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "sghtmltopdf"
```

Precompiled native gems are published for `x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`, `x86_64-linux-musl`, `aarch64-linux-musl`, `arm64-darwin`, and `x86_64-darwin`.
There is no build step on those platforms.

Elsewhere (Windows) the gem cannot run in-process — the source gem does not carry the Rust core and will refuse to build with an explanatory message.
Point those environments at a separate `sghtmltopdf server` process instead; see [Delegating to a server](#delegating-to-a-server).

Requires Ruby >= 3.2.

## Usage

```ruby
pdf = Sghtmltopdf.render("<h1>Invoice</h1>", page_size: "A4", margin_top: "20mm")
```

Option names are the CLI long options without `--` and with `-` replaced by `_`, so `--page-size A4` becomes `page_size: "A4"`.
The [option reference](https://waka.github.io/sghtmltopdf/en/usage/cli/reference.html) lists all of them.

Write straight to a file (written to a temporary file and renamed on success, so a failure never leaves a broken PDF behind), or take the bytes in chunks:

```ruby
Sghtmltopdf.render_to_file(html, "invoice.pdf", page_size: "A4")

Sghtmltopdf.render(html) { |bytes| io.write(bytes) }
```

## Header and footer HTML

Pass markup directly without creating temporary files:

```ruby
Sghtmltopdf.render(html,
  header_html_content: '<div>Invoice [title]</div>',
  footer_html_content: '<div>Page [page] of [topage]</div>')
```

These options work with `render`, block output, `render_to_file`, global
configuration, and server delegation. The shared CLI options are
`--header-html-content` and `--footer-html-content`.

`header_html` and `footer_html` still accept file paths. Supplying both a path
and content for the same side raises `Sghtmltopdf::UsageError`, including when
one comes from global configuration. `nil` or `false` disables a configured
option; an empty string is an explicitly empty header or footer. Either HTML
form takes precedence over simple text options for that side.

Content uses the same placeholder expansion and margin clipping as file input.
Embedded `data:` images are supported; external resources remain blocked.
With server delegation, markup travels in URL query parameters, so URL length
limits may apply and request logs may contain the markup.

## Rails

Adding the gem is enough; the Railtie wires everything up, and nothing is loaded when Rails is absent.

```ruby
# config/initializers/sghtmltopdf.rb
Sghtmltopdf.configure do |c|
  c.page_size   = "A4"
  c.gothic_font = Rails.root.join("vendor/fonts/NotoSansJP-Regular.ttf")
end
```

A `:pdf` renderer is registered, in the spirit of [wicked_pdf](https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf) — the same keys, so an existing controller often needs no change at all:

```ruby
class InvoicesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    render pdf: "invoice",              # filename; ".pdf" is appended
      template: "invoices/show",
      layout: "pdf",
      page_size: "A4", margin_top: "20mm"
  end
end
```

View-rendering keys (`template`, `layout`, `locals`, …) go to `render_to_string`, response keys (`filename`, `disposition`, `status`) go to `send_data`, `show_as_html: true` returns the HTML instead of a PDF, and everything else is passed to the converter.

`render_to_string(pdf: "invoice", template: "invoices/show")` returns PDF bytes without setting the controller response. You can then pass those bytes to `send_data` or save them elsewhere; response options such as `filename`, `disposition`, and `status` only apply to `render pdf:`.
Converter keys are flat CLI flag names, so wicked_pdf's nested `margin: {top: 10}` becomes `margin_top: "10mm"` (with the unit spelled out); the [migration guide](https://waka.github.io/sghtmltopdf/en/migration/wicked-pdf.html) maps every key one by one.

### Assets

PDF rendering does not go through the HTTP server, so `/assets/…` URLs are resolved as local files: the Railtie defaults `base_url` to `Rails.root/public` and restricts local reads to `public/` and the asset pipeline load paths via `allow_path`.
That is enough for a precompiled production app; in development the digested `/assets/…` path names no file on disk, so these helpers look the asset up in the pipeline instead — the CSS expanded into a `<style>`, the image referenced by the path the engine can read:

```erb
<%= sghtmltopdf_stylesheet_link_tag "pdf" %>
<%= sghtmltopdf_image_tag "logo.png" %>
```

`sghtmltopdf_stylesheet_link_tag` does not copy the CSS verbatim: it points every `url()` at a file the engine can read and splices in every `@import`.
The asset pipeline rewrites `url()` through `asset_path` while precompiling, which turns a `@font-face` source into a digested `/assets/…` path, or into an absolute URL once `asset_host` is set — neither can be fetched while rendering, and a `@font-face` that fails to load falls back to the engine default rather than to the next `font-family`.

A file `allow_path` does not cover is embedded as a `data:` URI instead, so that it cannot silently vanish from the PDF; pass `inline: true` to embed unconditionally.

### Streaming the response

To send pages as soon as their layout is final, pass a block and use `ActionController::Live` — this also makes `Rack::Timeout` and `Thread#kill` effective at chunk boundaries:

```ruby
class InvoicesController < ApplicationController
  include ActionController::Live

  def show
    response.headers["Content-Type"] = "application/pdf"
    html = render_to_string(template: "invoices/show", layout: "pdf")
    Sghtmltopdf.render(html) { |bytes| response.stream.write(bytes) }
  ensure
    response.stream.close
  end
end
```

## Delegating to a server

If the gem cannot run where your app runs, or you would rather not spend the app's CPU on rendering, set `server_url` and the same calls are delegated over HTTP to a separate `sghtmltopdf server` process.

```ruby
Sghtmltopdf.configure { |c| c.server_url = "http://pdf:8080" }
```

The [official Docker image](https://waka.github.io/sghtmltopdf/en/getting-started/docker.html) runs that server and bundles Japanese fonts.
